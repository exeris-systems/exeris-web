"""Exeris agent hook — one implementation, six vendor wire formats.

Reads the canonical definitions from `.agents/hooks/hooks.yaml`, so a pattern is authored once
(agents-md-schema.md rule 12). The rendered per-vendor hook files do nothing but invoke this
script with `--hook <id> --vendor <name>`; they carry no patterns of their own.

Wire shapes differ per vendor in two places and only two: what arrives on stdin, and what a
decision looks like on stdout. Everything between them is shared.

  stdin   Claude/Codex : {"tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": {"command": …, "file_path": …}}
          Copilot      : snake_case aliases of the same
          Cursor       : {"command": …} for beforeShellExecution
          Gemini       : {"toolName": …, "args": {…}}
          Antigravity  : {"tool_name": "run_command", "tool_input": {"command": …}}

  stdout  Claude/Codex/Copilot : {"hookSpecificOutput": {"permissionDecision": "deny", …}}
                                 and {"decision": "block", "reason": …} for a stop
          Cursor               : {"permission": "deny", "userMessage": …}
          Gemini/Antigravity   : {"decision": "deny", "reason": …}

Exit codes: 0 always, except where a vendor documents exit 2 as "blocked" and gives us no other
channel. The decision travels in the JSON; an exit code is a fallback, not the contract.

State lives under `.agents-state/<session>/` (git-ignored), keyed by the identifier the runtime
puts on the event. A shared directory would make a stop gate fire once per checkout and never
again — the first check ever run would discharge it for every session afterwards.

Failing closed is decided by `--on-error`, which the renderer sets from the hook's own `decision`
in hooks.yaml. It is NOT decided by the hook's name: a guarantee that holds only for hooks
someone happened to call `deny*` is not a guarantee, and the stop gate — the layer's actual
enforcement — is not called that. The default is `deny`, so a config this dispatcher cannot read
and a rendered command that predates this flag both fail in the safe direction.
